# Ntrip-client-tools-withserial
same code as in - https://github.com/liukai-tech/NtripClient-Tools
but i completed future feature #1, adding ability to send RTCM correction over serial port
with serial and reading is the same as supressed output but supressed output prints less to the command window,
the file with aughust 4th in the title is the newest one and is used in most of the other software
